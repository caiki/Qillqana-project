Qillqana-project
================

Qillqana-project is a degree thesis project, developed by Alex Irmel Oviedo Solis and Cesar R. Villacorta.

Qillqana is a quechua word that has many means as write, paint, draw, etc. We use this word to refer to a white board.

We hope to create an interactive whiteboard using an Android Tablet, computer and projector.

By now this our pre-alpha code :-)
